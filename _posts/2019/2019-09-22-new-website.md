It is no secret that the Pirate Party site was in dire need of a refresh in order to ensure that the party continues to appear modern and fresh, in line with our political views. The first in a series of changes is this, the new front site. This site will act as the primary news and media portal for the party, allowing people to keep up to date with piratical news. The site isn't quite finished, but it's certainly better than the old site. You may notice that not all content is available on the new site, but this will be rectified in the coming months as older content is ported over.

For now membership and voting functionality will remain on the legacy site, however, a project is planned to develop a replacement system for this functionality. Should you have some spare time and some competency in NodeJS/VueJS, please get in touch.

In true Pirate spirit, the main bulk of the site has come from our successful friends in PPCZ. I'd like to thank them for allowing us to use their site as a framework in true copyleft style with no restrictions. 

Should you notice anything amiss or want to get involved working on the site, get in contact on [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/n78g37W) or [**fork us on github.**](https://github.com/ppuk/jekyll-site)

## About the Pirate Party ##

The Pirate Party in the UK is a fledgling political party. It has fielded a few candidates in European and National elections, but like most small parties it is significantly constrained by the UK electoral system. Despite this, the Pirate Party has started to poll alongside major parties and is looking to build support from the grassroots. The party stood 10 candidates in the June 2017 General Election and briefly held 2 community councillors.
