Dear Party members,

Thank you to everyone who voted in the recent ballot.

## The Question ##

The question asked was "Should the party be dissolved?"

## Result ##

45 valid ballots were cast.  
They were recorded as:

> Yes         33  
> No          9  
> Abstain     3  

This gives 73% of the votes cast in favour of closing the party down.

## Next Steps ##

The NEC will, in co-ordination with the Board, start working out the dissolution of the Party and disposal of assets. Further information will be shared on [this site](https://pirateparty.org.uk) and on our [Discord Server](https://discord.pirateparty.org.uk). This result will also be sent out in communications to our members.
