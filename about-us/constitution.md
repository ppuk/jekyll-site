In multiple winner ERS97 STV elections, an additional question will be included on the ballot paper: "Re-Open Nominations?", with "Yes" or "No" as answers. If a simple majority of voters vote "Yes", the election process will be immediately restarted.

Prior to initiating an election, the Board will appoint a neutral team of election monitors to ensure all elections proceed fairly. This team must contain someone who is neither a candidate standing for election, a member seconding a candidate, nor be currently serving on the Board or the NEC.

Administration and monitoring of the vote may not be undertaken by any official with a direct interest in participants of the election. This includes candidates, nominators and seconders of candidates. Any such official wishing to participate in the election as a candidate, a nominator, or a seconder, may do so by ensuring they have no officiating role in the election.
