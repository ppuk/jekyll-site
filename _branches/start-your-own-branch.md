If there isn't an established branch close to you don't worry! There is plenty to do with the central party online or you could set up your own branch.

1. Head over to [Discord](https://discord.gg/n78g37W) its possible that there are already Pirates in your area
2. If after talking to fellow pirates you are happy to start a branch then post a blog on it and inform the leaders office
3. Complete a DPA form that we'll send you (all volunteers have too)
4. Standing for elections is a great way to attract new people to your branch
5. Both inside and outside of election times remain engaged in the community running events, visiting charities and dropping leaflets
6. Work with the press team to submit articles to your local paper to get even more local members
