I"Z<p>It is no secret that the Pirate Party site was in dire need of a refresh in order to ensure that the party continues to appear modern and fresh, in line with our political views. The first in a series of changes is this, the new front site. This site will act as the primary news and media portal for the party, allowing people to keep up to date with piratical news. The site isn’t quite finished, but it’s certainly better than the old site. You may notice that not all content is available on the new site, but this will be rectified in the coming months as older content is ported over.</p>
