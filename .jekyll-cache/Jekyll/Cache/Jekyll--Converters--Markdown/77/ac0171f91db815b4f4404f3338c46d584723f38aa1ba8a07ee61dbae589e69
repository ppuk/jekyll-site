I"Ñ<p>It often feels like we live in a â€œsay no first, ask questions laterâ€ society. Whether itâ€™s councils banning a 9 year old from blogging about school dinners or the government threatening to suspend social media, the Pirate Party has always stood up for freedom of speech.  The courts must not be used to block freedom of expression and knowledge, and a reform of libel laws is overdue to ensure this. The right to speak out is fundamental in democracy.</p>
