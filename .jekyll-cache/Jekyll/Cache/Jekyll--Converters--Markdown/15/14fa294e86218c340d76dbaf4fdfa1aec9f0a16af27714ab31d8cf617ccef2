I"Z<p>The Pirate Party wants a free and fair society where everyone can take part, with space to live, respect for all of our communities, and where basic human rights are the cornerstone of a fair society.</p>

<p>We oppose any attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act 1998 and believe the UK should remain a party to the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

<p>We have an obligation to provide sanctuary to those individuals who have been forced to flee their homes. We should ensure that those people who come to the UK seeking asylum are treated fairly and are given decisions quickly about their status. Once asylum seekers have been granted asylum they should be given assistance, including access to employment and education.</p>

<p>We want to see affordable homes for all. We would enable councils to build affordable council housing. Income from council housing sales would be ring-fenced for housing construction and councils would also be permitted to borrow to fund housing construction. We would introduce new statutory regulation of letting agents that all would be required to observe. This would include an independent ombudsman and a mandatory code of practice.</p>

<p>The Pirate Party would give residents new rights to freely use privately owned space that is in the public realm.</p>

<p>The right to protest without fear of reprisal is fundamental to a democratic society; we will stand up for this right.</p>

<p>We recognise the  value of whistleblowers to society and will defend the right of  citizens to expose illegal practices in the workplace and elsewhere. Exposing corrupt or illegal activities must take precedence; no-one should fear persecution for making the public aware of a breach of the law. The UK would grant asylum to whistleblowers fleeing foreign governments. Whistleblowing would become a protected trait similar to gender, age and sexuality, making it illegal for employers to discriminate against whistleblowers. Whistleblowers would be awarded a share of any fines levied based on their disclosure.</p>

<p>We must protect Sure Start services. It is vitally important that all children get the best possible start in life, but that alone isn’t  sufficient in dealing with the problems that the UK faces. The rationale under which Sure Start Children’s Centres were set up should be  extended, not rolled back. They have made life easier for millions of  families and could improve lives further. Sure Start should be be about  actively bringing down the levels of child poverty in the UK, not just a  start in life, and should provide ongoing support for whole families.</p>

<p>The current mechanism used to determine eligibility for the Employment and Support Allowance is failing many people in dire need of support. We would call for an immediate review of the assessment methods used and look for alternative ways to administrate assessments.</p>
