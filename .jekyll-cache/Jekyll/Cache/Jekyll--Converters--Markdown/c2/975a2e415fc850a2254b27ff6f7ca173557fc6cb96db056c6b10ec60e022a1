I"m<p>All UK citizens should be able to rely on the welfare system as a safety net. We believe the current system is failing and needs to be revitalised. A successful welfare system reaches everyone in need. Punitive measures on those who try to exploit the system hurt the needy. We would introduce measures to prevent people receiving unfair blocks on benefits.</p>
