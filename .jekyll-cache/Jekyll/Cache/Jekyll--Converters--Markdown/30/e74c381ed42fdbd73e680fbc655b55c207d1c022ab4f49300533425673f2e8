I"Ñ<p>The Mozilla Foundation has released a report regarding how healthy the Internet is. It is a compilation of research and stories that act as a barometer of the â€˜healthâ€™ of the Internet. The report argues that a healthy Internet is one that is free from online harassment and fake news, is secure both by protocols and from censorship, and finally, one that is open for competition unlike the state of play with the large monopolies of todayâ€™s Internet.</p>
