I" <p>The Welsh Senedd has recognised the right of 16 and 17 year olds to participate in elections for members of the Welsh Assembly. This is a significant step towards satisfying a long-held policy of Pirate Party UK (PPUK) that the right way to engage people in democracy is by trusting them and opening up the system to younger people. Young people see their lives and futures directed by governments over which they have no say: they can work and pay taxes from the age of 16, and they should be trusted and allowed to vote from that age.</p>
