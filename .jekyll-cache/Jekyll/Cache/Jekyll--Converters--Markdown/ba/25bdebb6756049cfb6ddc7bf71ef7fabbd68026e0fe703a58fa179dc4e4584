I"5<p>Our Local policies apply to County Council or Town Council levels.</p>

<p>We want our libraries to remain a free source of knowledge and information but also to do so much more in a passive, user-friendly way. Our security and anonymity should be protected when using a public machine and we should look to lessen the risk of using public internet connections.</p>

<p>Councils should be the frontier in what open source, production-ready software can be used to save the public purse some money and increase the circulation of open alternatives.</p>

<p>The communication between councils and the residents needs improvements across the UK. While some areas consultations have a sensible layout, in others they are completely different. Often a simply survey in one town while in others a full written response is necessary. Online consultations in a standard format will remedy this.</p>

<p>Councils should be expected to be completely open and transparent, lessening the need for FOI requests but should a FOI request be required, they should be easily accessible.</p>
