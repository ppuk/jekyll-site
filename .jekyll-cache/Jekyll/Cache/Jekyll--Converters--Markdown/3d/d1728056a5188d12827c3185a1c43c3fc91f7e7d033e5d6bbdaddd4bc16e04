I"<p>Every two years (as directed by our constitution) we hold elections for the
NEC. Every member in good standing is allowed to stand and vote in these
elections.</p>

<p>The NEC (the pompously named National Executive Committee) is responsible
for steering the Pirate Party, overseeing the day-to-day operation,
representing the party to the public, and generally being in charge.</p>

<p>The NEC is comprised of five elected officers with full voting rights.
Currently, we identify the following NEC roles:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Leader</li>
  <li>Deputy Leader / Head Spokesperson</li>
  <li>Treasurer</li>
  <li>Secretary</li>
  <li>Nominations Officer</li>
</ul>

<p>All five of these positions will be up for nomination and election. If you
want to learn more about the commitment and the roles, please contact any of
the current NEC or jump into the Discord #internal_elections channel.</p>

<p>The provisional timetable is:<br />
Nominations open 18th November<br />
Nominations close 2nd December<br />
Election starts 9th December<br />
Election ends 23rd December</p>

<p>Be the Pirate.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-pirate-party">About the Pirate Party</h2>

<p>The Pirate Party in the UK is a fledgling political party. It has fielded a few candidates in European and National elections, but like most small parties it is significantly constrained by the UK electoral system. Despite this, the Pirate Party has started to poll alongside major parties and is looking to build support from the grassroots. The party stood 10 candidates in the June 2017 General Election and briefly held 2 community councillors.
