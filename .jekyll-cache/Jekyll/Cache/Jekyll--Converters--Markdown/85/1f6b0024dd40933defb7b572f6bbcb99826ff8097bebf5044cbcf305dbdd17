I"Ó<p>The NEC and Board of Governors have been discussing the current state and the potential future of PPUK. You have probably noticed that the Party has been significantly less active since the 2017 General Election campaign. Although that was probably the most successful campaign the Party has fought (new manifesto, press launch, TV interviews, more candidates and votes than ever before), it seemed to sap everyoneâ€™s energy, and left the Party almost inert.</p>
